pairings: The Bixal palette is dynamic and flexible. There are a series of recommended   configurations of the palette to ensure accessible and eye-catching pairings that most effectively bring the Bixal brand to life. The color combinations below are compliant to AA and AAA contrast requirements for text and background.
ratio: Bixal has a robust color palette, but no more than two brand colors should be used at any given time. Black or white may be used as a tertiary color in some instances. For example, a PowerPoint presentation can utilize many colors, but there should only be two per slide.

# The Color Palette

Color is a powerful brand signal. So, much like us, our palette is energetic, strong and defined. A series of grouped hues integrates into one cohesive palette. The brand achieves more range through pairings from the light palette, the medium palette, the dark palette and the core body text palette.
