# How to choose imagery

## Portraits

Bixal Imagery should reinforce Bixal’s people-always-first approach and be intentional and deep. The portraiture style is expressive, intimate and uplifting. Our goal is to represent the challenges—and successes—of our clients across disciplines, sectors and borders. Satisfied, positive expressions reinforce the value that the Bixal brand brings to its clients and its teams. Choose images that hint at the livelihoods and challenges of those helped by Bixal clients. Images can feature multiple people as well. Avoid imagery that focuses on hands.

## Industry photography

Ultimately, Bixal is focused on outcomes. Industry imagery should focus on the results that may be achieved through Bixal partnership—rather than simply the actions taken. Pops of color evocative of the Bixal palette can enhance the overall experience and make these image choices feel even more purposeful.

## Thematic photography

Thematic photography should reinforce the transformation that is possible with Bixal as a partner. To communicate the core brand pillars and other abstract content categories, select images that evoke universal meaning. When selecting images that reinforce our focus in federal, choose photos that give a sense of scale and impact. Images that feature a more monochromatic palette can create bold contrast when paired with an opposing brand color in designs.
