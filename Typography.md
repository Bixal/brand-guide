# Typography

Throughout all brand communications, Bixal uses the **Novel Pro typeface family for feature copy**, and the **Proxima Nova typeface family for body copy**. These two typefaces seamlessly adapt as both display and utility fonts with a wide range of weights and faces ideal for various typographic constructs.

These fonts are purchasable through Adobe Fonts:<br>

[Novel](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/novel){: .usa-button .bg-bixal-purple hover:bg-primary}
[Proxima Nova](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova){: .usa-button .bg-bixal-purple}

![]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/typography-intro.png){: .margin-y-5}

## Placement of text blocks

To establish text placement, align copy with one of the lower three quadrants of the vertical page. Use left alignment.

![]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/typography-placement.png){: .margin-y-2}

## Fallback fonts

- **Georgia** should be used in place of Novel Pro if the brand font is not available
- **Helvetica** should be used in place of Proxima Nova
